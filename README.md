# <span style="colour: red;">A Comparative Study of Faith Through the Body in Medieval Christianity and Indigenous Spirituality</span>
## The Body as a means of spiritual expression 
Throughout the history, the body has always been essential to religion and spiritual expression, serving as both fascination and controversy. There has been many questions like,  is the body sacred, is it a source of temptation and sin that needs discipline and denial? This tension shapes religious thought across cultures, where the body is simultaneously celebrated as holy and seen as flawed. The body has been seen as sacred, a vessel for divine connection, and simultaneously as something to be denied, controlled and sometimes even punished. Despite these conflicting views, the body remains a site for spiritual expression, acting as a foundation for how faith is both expressed and understood. Whether through ascetic practices in medieval Christianity or the celebration of the body as sacred in indigenous spirituality, the body becomes a medium of spiritual expression. Robert Fuller, in *Religion and the Body*, highlights the body’s role as an essential medium of religious expression, symbolizing both the connection between the physical and spiritual aspects of life and the tension between bodily desires and spiritual goals. This foundational perspective sets the stage for understanding how two distinct traditions, medieval Christian mysticism and Indigenous spirituality frame the body as both sacred and transformative. In medieval Christianity, the female body became a focal point for ascetic practices, mystic visions, and pathways to divine connection, as seen in the life of Mary of Oignies. Her experiences reflect how the body, through self-discipline and self- denial, could transcend and unite with the divine. Conversely, within Indigenous spiritual traditions like those of the Blackfoot and Lakota communities, the body is revered as an important link to the spiritual realm. Women’s roles, especially in certain ceremonies and rituals such as the Blackfoot Sun Dance, emphasize the body’s innate sacredness and power to sustain communal and spiritual harmony. By exploring these traditions, this project explores the comparative role of the body in these traditions, analyzing how cultural beliefs and religious practices shape views of the body as an embodiment of faith and a vessel for spirituality, offering a powerful lens to understand the interplay between spirituality and gender. 
## Theoretical Framework: The Body and Religious Practices 
The relationship between religion and the body is deeply intertwined, shaping how people engage with their faith and connect with the divine. As Robert Fuller explains in his article *“Religion and the Body”*, the body is not simply a vessel in religious practices but an active participant. Fuller examines religion as a cultural force that shapes attitudes toward the body, particularly through practices such as dietary restrictions, extreme fasting, bodily mortification, and ritual movements. He emphasizes that these practices are not merely symbolic, but they actively shape religious experiences, evoking emotions like reverence, humility, and connection to the divine. Fuller argues that  
> ***“Religions, after all, quite literally map themselves onto our bodies. They invoke cosmic authority for highly specific commandments regarding our diets, clothing, sexual behavior, healing practices, and funeral customs. Ritual behavior enacts these worldviews by requiring us to adopt bodily postures (e.g., prostration, kneeling, sitting in yogic positions) deemed appropriate to our ontological status.”***

These bodily actions, like kneeling, prostrating, or assuming other ritual postures, are outward expressions of inward beliefs. They serve as tools for enhancing spiritual engagement, allowing them to form a deeper connection with their faith. Fuller highlights how religious practices shape bodily movements, and in turn, how these movements influence spiritual experiences. Both medieval Christianity and Indigenous spiritual traditions rely on the body to physically manifest belief. This reinforces the idea that the body is not only a vessel but an active participant in worship and spiritual engagement. Fuller also explores how religious expressions are influenced by the body’s innate response to its environment. For instance, synchronized movements in religious rituals, like dancing, can trigger neurological responses that foster a sense of connection. In Indigenous communities, ritual postures and communal dances serve to create solidarity, while in medieval Christianity, shared acts of penance or prayer reinforce communal identity and devotion. On the other hand, practices like extreme fasting, bodily mortification, and other forms of self-discipline on the body serve as tool to purify the spirit and draw the spirit closer to the divine. This is particularly significant for medieval Christian women, who engaged in ascetic practices as a way to elevate their spiritual lives, mirror Christ suffering and deepen their connection to God. These extreme acts were not just about self-discipline, but they saw it something essential to their spiritual identity, expression and devotion. Fuller's perspective directly connects to my focus on how both medieval Christianity and Indigenous spirituality use the body as a sacred instrument. Fuller’s ideas about the body and religious practices show how bodily actions and ascetic practices are essential for expressing faith in both medieval Christian and Indigenous traditions. By examining these practices through a cultural lens, I will explore how both traditions, particularly for women, use the body to foster spiritual connection. This supports my thesis, demonstrating that the body is central to religious life in both medieval Christianity and Indigenous spirituality, and how these bodily practices help women connect with the divine. This connection between the body and religious practices is foundational to understanding how the body acts as a sacred instrument in both medieval Christian and Indigenous spiritual contexts.

## Mary of Oigines’ Role in Ascetic Practices: The Body as a vessel for Divine Connection 
In medieval Christianity, the body was seen as both a vessel of temptation and a tool for spiritual transformation. For medieval Christian women, this became an issue as the Church’s teachings on ascetic practices was often about the societal expectations around women's purity and piety. Asceticism, the act of denying oneself physical and earthly desires was a way to achieve spiritual growth and expression. For medieval Christian women, this was not only a means of devotion but also a way for women to assert their spiritual agency in a patriarchal society. The body became a tool for spiritual transformation, where bodily affliction could mirror Christ's suffering and further elevate their connection with God. 
## The life of Mary of Oignies 
Mary of Oignies was a prominent figure in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. She engaged in this extreme form of asceticism. Her extreme fasting, self-inflicted mortifications, and bodily afflictions were not acts of mere piety but expressions of her deep spiritual devotion. For Mary, i believe she saw her body  as a sacred vessel through which she could share in the suffering of Christ and experience a more intimate connection with the Him.This act went beyond just her doing her religious duty but they became an important way for expressing her mystical experiences and also as a way to stand up against certain constraints as a woman during her time. Several holy women of the time were believed to exude miraculous fluids, like oil or milk. Mary was specifically known for her excessive crying. Mary's excessive weeping became another important way for her spritual expression of connecting with God. It was far from being seen asa form of weakness, but rather her tears were seen as a spiritual gift from God. James of Vitry, her biographer, described her tears as *'her refreshing'*, which like I said was seen as a form of spiritual expression that brought her closer to Christ. There was this nne time a priest once tried to silence her weeping during Mass, but Mary's prayer caused the priest himself to be overcome with tears, illustrating how her expressions of faith could impact others in the community. Mary’s excessive weeping in this way wasn’t merely a personal form of expression but now served as a shared spiritual experience, which influenced those around her. This spiritual expression of her tears further emphasizes the way Mary’s body became a bridge between the physical and the divine. Her physical suffering, which at times seemed extreme, became a channel through which others were able to connect with God. This reinforces Fuller's idea that the body could not only be a vessel for persoanl spiritual expression but also serves as a source of shared expression within the community. 
## The Body as a Vessel for Spiritual Expression in Indigenous Traditions 
In Indigenous traditions, particularly within the Blackfoot and Lakota communities, the body is seen as an exteremely significant vessel for spiritual connection, expression, and unity within their communities. Unlike medieval Christianity, where ascetic practices often emphasize suffering to transcend the physical, Indigenous traditions see the body as sacred, which shows that there is a deep connection between the physical and spritual realms. In these cultures, the body is not seen as something to be denied or purified but is celebrated as a channel for spiritual connection and power. This approach shows that we as humans are deeply connected to the earth and the divine, and that the physical body is an essential part of this relationship. Both the Blackfoot and Lakota communities recognize women's inherent spiritual power, which is deeply tied to their roles as intermediaries between the divine and their community. This power goes beyond their role as life givers and is expressed through their participation in sacred ceremonies, control over ritual objects, and symbolic roles that sustain the material and spiritual well-being of their communities. 
## The Blackfoot Community
In the Blackfoot tradition, the women were known for their innate spiritual power, their role as life givers, and their role as mediators between the spiritual realm and their community. This is particularly shown in their control over sacred medicine bundles, objects that are central to Blackfoot ceremonies. Only women are entrusted with the handling and opening of these sacred bundles.

The *Okan* (Sun Dance), which is one of the Blackfoot’s most significant ceremony is said cannot take place without the presence or leadership of a *holy woman*, a priestess who goes through demanding and extreme spiritual work on behalf of her people. Her role requires extreme sacrifices, including fasting, prayer, and giving up her personal wealth and comforts for the good of the community. Through these embodied actions, she channels spiritual energy that brings blessings of prosperity and health to her community. This spiritual devotion shows the Blackfoot communities understand the body as a vessel for spiritual power. This embodied spirituality is a direct contrast to the medieval Christian view, where asceticism often involved transcending or denying the body to attain spiritual purity qnd connection. In Blackfoot traditions the body acts as a vessel for spiritual power and a means of invoking the divine. This shows the community’s reliance on the spiritual power of women reflecting how these roles and sacrifices are vital to maintaining both the physical and spiritual well-being of their community. 
## The Lakota Community 
In Lakota tradition, women’s bodies are seen as powerful spiritual vessels, much like in Blackfoot culture. The White Buffalo Calf Woman, who is a key figure in Lakota traditions embodies virtues like generosity and hospitality. Her arrival marks an importannt moment in Lakota spirituality, where she brings the sacred pipe and rituals like the Sun Dance to the Lakota people.

"Apparition of the Buffalo Calf Madiden." *World History Encyclopedia* Last modified September 07, 2023 [https://www.worldhistory.org/image/17890/apparition-of-the-buffalo-calf-maiden/](https://www.worldhistory.org/image/17890/apparition-of-the-buffalo-calf-maiden/).

Her story shows the vital role women play in transmitting spiritual power and maintaining balance within the community. Athough, the Sun Dance is led by a male intercessor also known as the *wicasa wakan*, the role of women are also as just as important. They were responsible for preparing food, organizing gifts, and offering guidance to female dancers. These actions mirror the virtues of the White Buffalo Calf Woman which emphasize women’s role in the community. The story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman continues to guide Lakota women, inspiring them to embody virtues such as generosity, industriousness, and hospitality. Her story reinforces the profound connection between women, nature, and the spiritual realm which views the female body as a sacred vessel capable of channeling spiritual connection and blessings for the community. An interesting aspect of Lakota spirituality is the role of young, virtuous girls in the Sun Dance. These virgins are chosen to chop down the cottonwood tree, which becomes the sacred center pole. Women also protect the sacred tree during the ceremony by laying down clothes to prevent it from touching the earth which further symbolizes their role as protectors.
## Comparative Analysis: Embodied Faith 
Both medieval Christian and Indigenous traditions viewed the body, particularly the female body, as a crucial element in embodying faith and expressing spiritual connection. However, their approaches are significantly different because of their distinct theological understandings and cultural contexts. In medieval Christianity, particularly in the case of women like Mary of Oignies, the body is often seen as source of temptation which requires discipline, mortification, and denial to achieve spiritual transcendence and connection and mirror Christ’s suffering. Indigenous spirituality specifically in Blackfoot and Lakota traditions on the other hand, see the body as sacred instrument which is essential from connecting the physical to the spiritual world and a medium through which blessings are brought to their communities. While their expressions of spirituality differ, these traditions share a common ground that the female body is not m merely a vessel but it is important for connection to the divine, for bestowing blessings, and ensuring the continuity of life itself. By recognizing this shared reverence for the body, we get to appreciate the complexity of different religious traditions and show the significance of the physical body in spiritual experiences and devotion.
